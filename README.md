BLADE is a modern, high-performance signal-processing library for radio telescopes, such as the Allen Telescope Array. Written in modern C++20, it utilizes CUDA for accelerated processing, Python bindings for ease of use, and a just-in-time (JIT) compilation of CUDA kernels for runtime customizability. BLADE is designed to be flexible and extensible to support other radio telescopes. 

- üåå Optimized for high-throughput signal-processing for radio telescopes.
- üì° Used in production in world-class radio telescopes like the Allen Telescope Array.
- üíª Deep CUDA integration for superior performance and efficiency.
- üêç Complete Python bindings for seamless integration with scientific computing.
- üß∞ Comprehensive C++20 support for robust and maintainable codebase.
- üîÑ Modular DSP architecture for flexible and extensible signal-processing solutions.
- üöÄ Just-in-time (JIT) compilation of CUDA kernels for maximum performance and runtime customizability.

The library is structured into Modules, Pipelines, and Runners:

- **Modules**: Handle data manipulation and processing (e.g. Beamformer, Channelizer, Polarizer, etc).
- **Pipelines**: Integrate Modules to form a processing pipeline (e.g. Beamformer + Channelizer).
- **Runners**: Execute Pipelines asynchronously for optimal parallelization.

Currently, BLADE implements the following Modules:

- **Beamformer**: Performs beamforming on a set of antennas.
- **Channelizer**: Converts a time series into a frequency series.
- **Detector**: Integrates and calculates the Stokes-I.
- **Polarizer**: Converts a horizontal and vertical polarization into a left and right circular polarization.
- **Caster**: Converts the input data type to another data type.
- **Stacker**: Tiles the input data into a larger Tensor axis.
- **Duplicator**: Copies the input data into a new Tensor.
- **Permutator**: Transposes the input data axis into a new order.
- **Integrator**: Sums the input data into a accumulator.
- **Correlator**: Performs correlation on a set of antennas.

All frequency values are in Hertz and all angles are in radians!

## Installation
Don't worry, it is not difficult! Follow the instructions below to compile it on your system. Keep in mind that BLADE requires a Linux system with an NVIDIA Graphics Card. A Docker image is also available for building and testing BLADE. To build it, run `docker build -t blade .` and to run it, run `docker run --rm -it --gpus all blade bash`. The Docker image is based on Ubuntu 22.04 and contains all the dependencies required to build and test BLADE. The [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit) is required to run this image.

### Step 1: Dependencies
BLADE requires a C++20 compiler (>GCC-11 or >Clang 14.0), the [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com) build system, [Ninja Build](https://ninja-build.org), and [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) (CUDA >11.7). Follow the instructions below to install the dependencies and build BLADE from source.

#### Ubuntu 22.04
Core dependencies (you probably already have them).
```bash
$ apt install git build-essential pkg-config git cmake
```

Python dependencies.
```bash
$ apt install python3-dev python3-pip
```

Build dependencies. These are installed by Python because Ubuntu 22.04 only offers old versions of them.
```bash
$ python3 -m pip install meson ninja
```

Modules dependencies.
```bash
$ apt install liberfa-dev libhdf5-dev
```

Test and benchmark dependencies (optional).
```bash
$ apt install libbenchmark-dev libgtest-dev 
```

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install numpy astropy pandas
```

Finally, to install the CUDA Toolkit, follow the official NVIDIA instructions [here](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#ubuntu). Make sure to install the CUDA Toolkit version 11.4 or higher.

### Step 2: Install
There are two ways to install BLADE. The first one will install only the Python bindings and the second one will install the Python bindings and the C++ library. If you plan to use BLADE exclusively from Python, it's recommended to install the Python bindings. Otherwise, install the C++ library.

#### Python Library
```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/luigifcruz/blade.git
```

#### C++ and Python Library
Clone the repository from Github.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/luigifcruz/blade.git
$ cd blade
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Build and install `release` version.
```bash
$ meson build && cd build
$ ninja install
```

Or build and install `debug` version.
```bash
$ meson -Dbuildtype=debugoptimized build && cd build
$ ninja install
```

## Usage
A command-line interface is expected to be added in the future. For now, the library can be used in Python or C++. The Python bindings are automatically installed when the library is installed. The C++ library can be used by including the header file (`#include <blade/base.hh>`) in your project. Navigate to the [examples](./examples) directory to see demonstrations of how to use the library. Peeking at the code inside [tests](./tests) and [benchmarks](./benchmarks) directories is also a good way to learn how to use BLADE.

## About
BLADE was created originally as the beamforming engine for the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). Since then, the library has grown to support other workloads like the High-Resolution Spectrometer (HRS). The library is designed to be flexible and extensible to support other radio telescopes with ongoing efforts to upstream the Very Large Array (VLA) COSMIC support. The library is written in modern C++20 and makes use of a just-in-time (JIT) compilation of CUDA kernels to deliver accelerated processing with runtime customizability. Performant Python bindings are also available. Regular talks about BLADE were given at multiple conferences and are available [here](https://luigi.ltd/talks/).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests and invite you to submit pull requests directly in this repository. The library follows the [Google C++ Code Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). The default line length is 88. This can be overridden if necessary. Please, be sensible.
